<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>
<a href="documents/google-termination.pdf">Here you may view the email whereby Google terminated my employment over email.</a>
<ul>
<li>the allegations in here are not even true,</li>
<li>but even if they were, note the wrong action and tone of this email.</li>
<li>It was arbitrary and cruel, and in response to my being ill, and saying I was ill. The very last communication I had with them was a hasty email I wrote to say that no need to contact my emergency contact, which is my little brother, as I am responsible for him -- which was immediately met with this nasty termination.</li> 
<li>I'm rather exhausted, and would have need time and effort and some skill to truly organize the complaint, but you may also view the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recovery-brighter-2018-applying-law-school-sue-yi-chew/">LinkedIn post</a> I wrote about this issue, and my <a href="documents/sueyichew_rutgers_personal_statement.pdf">consequent application to law school</a>.</li>
<li>I have also been ranting on Twitter. You may notice the sharp negative turn of mood since late 2016. It's not been easy, I had to pull myself out from the depths of this very difficult situation that I was pushed in, and am still working on it. God willing.</li>
<li>Months later through over a year later, Google also sent me multiple email requests for my signature to sign off on their patent applications, as inventor, that were started before the termination. I don't know they reconcile their actions.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br/>
